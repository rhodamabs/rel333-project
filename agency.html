                  <p>October 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>The intended meaning or message of a parable typically is not expressed explicitly.
                     Rather, the story only conveys divine truth to a receiver in proportion to his or her
                      faith in God, personal spiritual preparation, and willingness to learn. Thus, an 
                      individual must exercise moral agency and actively “ask, seek, and knock”6 to discover 
                      the truths embedded in a parable. </q>

                  <p>October 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>To be or to become chosen is not an exclusive status conferred upon us. Rather, you
                     and I ultimately can choose to be chosen through the righteous exercise of our moral agency. </q>

                  <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>We are free to choose, but we cannot choose the consequences of not following the revealed
                     path.19 The Lord has said, “That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh 
                     to become a law unto itself, … cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor 
                     judgment.”20 We cannot deviate from Heavenly Father’s course and then blame Him for inferior 
                     outcomes. </q>

                  <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>As we do our part, His promise is that we will be called the 
                    “children of God.” Every person on earth is the “offspring”3 of God, but to be called
                     the “children of God” means much, much more. As we come unto Jesus Christ and make covenants 
                     with Him, we become “his seed” and “heirs of the kingdom,”4 “children of Christ, his sons, and
                      his daughters. </q>

                  <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>Heavenly Father has given each individual his or her moral agency, with the ability to 
                    choose one’s own path.10 This agency is one of the greatest gifts of God. </q>

                  <p>October 2020 General Conference</p>
                  <q>The word willing is crucial to this interpretation of Israel.5 We all have our agency.
                     We can choose to be of Israel, or not. We can choose to let God prevail in our lives, or not. 
                     We can choose to let God be the most powerful influence in our lives, or not. </q>

                  <p>October 2020 General Conference</p>
                  <q>Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most 
                    important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants
                     to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? 
                     Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? 
                     Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His?18 </q>

                  <p>October 2021 general conference</p>
                  <q>The sublime principle of agency does, of course, allow us to write our own stories—David could
                     have gone home, back to tending sheep. But Jesus Christ stands ready to use us as divine 
                     instruments, sharpened pencils in His hand, to write a masterpiece!  </q>

                  <p>October 2021 general conference</p>
                  <q>We will be judged by our book of life. We can choose to write a comfortable narrative for
                     ourselves. Or we can allow the Master Author and Finisher to write our story with us, letting 
                     the role He needs us to play take precedence over other ambitions. </q>

                  <p>April 2021 General Conference</p>
                  <q>God has given His children moral agency—the power to decide and to act. 
                    The most desirable condition for the exercise of that agency is maximum freedom for men and 
                    women to act according to their individual choices.  </q>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <h3><u>Position Statement</u></h3>
                <p>Agency is a special gift we have been given by our Heavenly Father. Though we can choose what 
                  we want, we do not choose the results of our choices. I should use the light of Christ to help 
                  me choose options that will bless me and my posterity. I can allow Christ to be the author of 
                  my life stories, I can choose to accept the will of my Heavenly Father in my life. I can choose 
                  to let God prevail in my life and be blessed as a result. I know He loves me and wants the best
                   for me. All I need is to trust Him and have faith in His process. </p>
