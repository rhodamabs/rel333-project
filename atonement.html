                  <q>Christ would take away sin. Without the Savior’s Atonement,
                     the eternal principle of justice would require punishment. Because of the 
                     Savior’s Atonement, mercy can prevail for those who have repented, and it can 
                     allow them to return to the presence of God. We would do well to ponder 
                     this wonderful doctrine. </q>

                  <q>None can return to God by his or her own good works alone; 
                    we all need the benefit of the Savior’s sacrifice. 
                    All have sinned, and it is only through the Atonement of Jesus Christ that
                     we can obtain mercy and live with God. </q>

                  <q>Central in God’s plan of redemption and happiness, Jesus Christ, through 
                    His Atonement, promises to unite our spirit and body, “never again to be divided, 
                    that [we] might receive a fulness of joy. </q>

                  <q>Atonement—at-one-ment in Christ—comes as we exercise faith and bring forth 
                    fruits unto repentance. As in mortality, so in immortality. Temple ordinances 
                    do not of themselves change us or those in the spirit world. But these divine 
                    ordinances enable sanctifying covenants with the Lord, which can bring harmony
                     with Him and each other. </q>

                  <p>October 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>As we take up our crosses and follow Him, it would be tragic indeed if the weight of
                     our challenges did not make us more empathetic for and more attentive to the burdens 
                     being carried by others. It is one of the most powerful paradoxes of the Crucifixion that 
                     the arms of the Savior were stretched wide open and then nailed there, unwittingly but 
                     accurately portraying that every man, woman, and child in the entire human family is not 
                     only welcome but invited into His redeeming, exalting embrace </q>

                  <p>October 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>As the glorious Resurrection followed the agonizing Crucifixion, so blessings of 
                    every kind are poured out on those who are willing, as the Book of Mormon prophet 
                    Jacob says, to “believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross.” Sometimes 
                    these blessings come soon and sometimes they come later, but the marvelous conclusion to 
                    our personal via dolorosa is the promise from the Master Himself that they do and will come. </q>

                  <q>No matter how capable, educated, brilliant, or strong we are, we cannot cleanse ourselves from
                    our sins, change our bodies to an immortal state, or exalt ourselves. It is only possible 
                    through the Savior Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement </q>

                    perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.” Our perfection is only possible

                  <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>You can survive. You have in fact already been rescued; you have already been saved—by the 
                    One who has suffered the very torment you are suffering and endured the very agony you are 
                    enduring. Jesus has overcome the abuses of this world2 to give you power to not only survive 
                    but one day, through Him, to overcome and even conquer—to completely rise above the pain, the
                     misery, the anguish, and see them replaced by peace. </q>

                  <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>Though it may seem impossible, feel impossible, healing can come through the miracle of the 
                    redemptive might of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, who is risen “with healing in his wings.”
                    Our merciful Savior, victorious over darkness and depravity, has power to right all wrongs, 
                    a life-giving truth for those wronged by others. </q>

                <h3><u>Position Statement</u></h3>
                <p>Jesus Christ is my savior and my redeemer. It is a painful thing not to have your own children when
                   you see others have children so easily. My heart bleeds and has shed many tears. My comfort comes
                    from the knowledge that I am known and loved. The pain, I feel is only a small portion of what I 
                    could have felt if Christ had not suffered and carried my burden. The atonement covers more than 
                    my sins. My heartache, and my sorrows, help me forgive even those that will never ask for forgiveness.
                     It is through Christ’s atonement that we are healed. </p>
