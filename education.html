                  <p>October 2012</p>
                  <q>Young men, you need to do well in school and then continue your education beyond high school. 
                    Some of you will want to pursue university studies and careers in business, agriculture, 
                    government, or other professions. Some will excel in the arts, music, or teaching.
                     Others will choose a military career or learn a trade. Over the years, I have had a number 
                     of craftsmen work on projects and repairs at my home, and I have admired the hard work and
                      skill of these men. In whatever you choose, it is essential that you become proficient so 
                      that you can support a family and make a contribution for good in your community and your 
                      country. </q>

                    acquainted and interact with others, how to relate to women and girls, how to serve, 
                    how to be active and enjoy recreation, how to pursue hobbies without becoming addicted, 
                    how to correct mistakes and make better choices. </q>

                  <q>educated. If formal education is not available, do not allow that to prevent you from 
                    acquiring all the knowledge you can. Under such circumstances, the best books, in a sense, 
                    can become your “university”—a classroom that is always open and admits all who apply. 
                    Strive to increase your knowledge of all that is “virtuous, lovely, or of good report or 
                    praiseworthy.”11 Seek knowledge “by study and also by faith.” </q>

                  <q>education is not merely a good idea—it’s a commandment. We are to learn “of things both in
                    heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things 
                    which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad.” </q>

                  <p>April 2010</p>
                  <q>Teaching a man to fish feeds him for a lifetime. As parents and gospel instructors,
                     you and I are not in the business of distributing fish; rather, our work is to help our 
                     children learn “to fish” and to become spiritually steadfast. This vital objective is best 
                     accomplished as we encourage our children to act in accordance with correct principles—as 
                     we help them to learn by doing. “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, 
                     whether it be of God” (John 7:17). Such learning requires spiritual, mental, and physical 
                     exertion and not just passive reception. </q>

                  <p>April 2010</p>
                  <q>The spiritual understanding you and I have been blessed to receive, and which has been 
                    confirmed as true in our hearts, simply cannot be given to our children. The tuition of 
                    diligence and of learning by study and also by faith must be paid to obtain and personally 
                    “own” such knowledge. Only in this way can what is known in the mind also be felt in the heart. 
                    Only in this way can a child move beyond relying upon the spiritual knowledge and experiences of 
                    parents and adults and claim those blessings for himself or herself. Only in this way can our 
                    children be prepared spiritually for the challenges of mortality. </q>

                  <p>October 2021 general conference</p>
                  <q>First, focus on where you are headed and not where you began. It would be wrong to ignore your 
                    circumstances—they are real and need to be addressed. But overfocusing on a difficult starting 
                    point can cause it to define you and even constrain your ability to choose. the Lord will “help
                     you more than you can help yourself. [So] involve the Lord in this process.” The prophet Nephi 
                     taught “that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.”9 We must do our best, 
                     which includes repentance, but it is only through the Lord’s grace that we can realize our 
                     divine potential</q>

                  <p>October 2015</p>
                  <q>Education prepares you for better employment opportunities. It puts you in a better position 
                    to serve and to bless those around you. It will set you on a path of lifelong learning. It will 
                    strengthen you to fight against ignorance and error. As Joseph Smith taught: “Knowledge does 
                    away with darkness, suspense and doubt; for these cannot exist where knowledge is. … In 
                    knowledge there is power.” “To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.” 
                    Education will prepare you for what is ahead, including marriage. </q>

                  <p>April 2012</p>
                  <q> Education … will open the doors of opportunity.”2 As you follow the Lord’s admonition to 
                    “seek learning, even by study and also by faith,” you gain not only knowledge from your study but 
                    added light as you learn by faith.</q>

                  <q>The pattern of study you establish during your formal schooling will in 
                    large measure affect your lifelong thirst for knowledge.” “You must get all of the education that you
                     possibly can. … Sacrifice anything that is needed to be sacrificed to qualify yourselves to do the work of 
                     [this] world. … Train your minds and hands to become an influence for good as you go forward with your lives. </q>
