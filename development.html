                  <p> April 2002</p>
                  <q>Sisters, take a close look at the suggested topics for home, family, and personal enrichment
                     meeting and find ways to build spiritual strength, develop personal skills, strengthen the 
                     home and family, and provide gospel service. By so doing, we will become less preoccupied with 
                     our problems and more dependent on God. </q>

                  <p>April 1985</p>
                  <q>Let’s not just talk about what we want to be. Let’s not just dream about what we want to be. 
                    Let’s just do it, whatever it takes. To reach your goals, you may have to work harder than you 
                    have ever worked before in your entire life. </q>

                  <p>October 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>I believe the Savior Jesus Christ would want you to see, feel, and know that He is your strength.
                     That with His help, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. That your potential is limitless. 
                     He would want you to see yourself the way He sees you. And that is very different from the way the world 
                     sees you. </q>

                  <q>It is the reason why you’re on the earth—to learn, grow, and progress and become everything your Father

                  <q> But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It requires both sacrifice and consecration.
                      It requires letting some things go and letting other things grow.</q>

                  <q>It is good to have goals and plans for our careers, for our education,
                      even for our golf game. It is also important to have goals for our marriages,
                      our families, and our Church councils and calling</q>

                  <p>April 2017</p>
                  <q>I have found that to stay focused on returning and receiving the promised blessings,
                      I need to regularly take time to ask myself, “How am I doing? </q>

                  <q>But this cannot happen if we hide behind personal, dogmatic, or organizational facades.
                      Such artificial discipleship not only keeps us from seeing ourselves as who we really are, 
                      but it also prevents us from truly changing through the miracle of the Savior’s Atonement. </q>

                  <p>April 2015</p>
                  <q>there may be times in our lives when rising up and continuing on may seem beyond our own ability.
                      That day on a snow-covered slope, I learned something. Even when we think we cannot rise up, there is still hope. </q>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <h3><u>Position Statement</u></h3>
                <p>I should work hard and multiply the talents I have been given. I am a divine daughter of God 
                  and with his help can develop my skills and make a difference in my life and the lives of those
                   around me. There is no limit to my potential for my Father is there to help me be the best 
                   version of myself. It will not be easy but I should not give up. I should not only dream and
                    do nothing, but I should also dream and act on faith and Heavenly Father will assist me 
                    to succeed. When I develop my skills my focus will shift from problems to opportunities.</p>
