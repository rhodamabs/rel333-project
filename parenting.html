                  <p>October 2022 general conference</p>
                  <q>My dear brothers and sisters, nurturing and presiding are opportunities, not exclusive 
                    limitations. One person may have a responsibility for something but may not be the only person 
                    doing it. When loving parents well understand these two major responsibilities, they will 
                    strive together to protect and care for the physical and emotional well-being of their 
                    children. They also help them face the spiritual dangers of our day by nurturing them with the 
                    good word of the Lord as revealed to His prophets </q>

                  <p>October 2018</p>
                  <q>Latter-day Saint women understand that being a mother is their highest priority, their 
                    ultimate joy. President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “Women for the most part see their greatest 
                    fulfillment, their greatest happiness in home and family. God planted within women something 
                    divine that expresses itself in quiet strength, in refinement, in peace, in goodness, in 
                    virtue, in truth, in love. And all of these remarkable qualities find their truest and most 
                    satisfying expression in motherhood. </q>

                  <p>October 2018</p>
                  <q>The greatest job that any woman will ever do will be in nurturing and teaching and living and
                     encouraging and rearing her children in righteousness and truth. There is no other thing that will compare
                      with that, regardless of what she does. </q>

                  <p>April 2017</p>
                  <q>Surely love would compel parents to warn their closest “neighbors”—their own children. This 
                    means teaching and testifying of gospel truths. It means teaching children the doctrine of 
                    Christ: faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.17 The Lord reminds parents,
                     “I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth. </q>

                <p>April 2017</p>
                  <q>A crucial element of the parental duty to warn is to paint not only the demoralizing 
                    consequences of sin but also the joy of walking in obedience to the commandments. </q>

                  <p>April 2016</p>
                  <q>Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and 
                    a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.Husband and wife have a solemn 
                    responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. … Parents have a sacred 
                    duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and 
                    spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another [and] observe the commandments 
                    of God. </q>

                  <p>April 2016</p>
                  <q>No matter what our particular family situation is, it is critical that we understand the 
                    unique circumstances of each family member. Though we may share DNA, there may be situations 
                    and circumstances among us that may make us vastly different from each other and which may 
                    require the compassionate collaboration of the family council. </q>

                  <p>April 2016</p>
                  <q>Now, brothers and sisters, there was a time when the walls of our homes provided all the 
                    defense we needed against outside intrusions and influences. We locked the doors, closed the 
                    windows; we shut the gates; and we felt safe, secure, and protected in our own little refuge 
                    from the outside world. <br>
                    Those days are now gone. The physical walls, doors, fences, and gates of our homes cannot 
                    prevent unseen invasion from the Internet, the Wi-Fi, the mobile phones, the networks. They can 
                    penetrate our homes with just a few clicks and keystrokes. </q>

                  <p>October 2016</p>
                  <q>Our Christian love and service naturally begin in the home. Parents, you are called to be loving teachers
                     and missionaries to your children and youth. They are your investigators. You bear the responsibility to help 
                     them become converted. In truth, all of us are seeking to be converted—which means being filled with our 
                     Savior’s love. </q>

                  <q>Parents and grandparents, we tend to bemoan the state of the world—that schools are not teaching 
                    moral character. But there is much we can do. We can take advantage of the teaching moments in our own 
                    families—that means now. Don’t let them slip by. When an opportunity comes to share your thoughts about the
                     gospel and the lessons of life, stop everything, sit down, and talk with your children and grandchildren. </q>

                <h3><u>Position Statement</u></h3>
                <p>Children are entitled to be born in a home with parents who honor their marital vows. They work
                   together as equal partners to teach and nurture their children in the ways of the Lord. They 
                    develop their own testimonies so they can withstand the fiery darts of the evil one. Their 
                    children are their investigators. They have a responsibility to help them be converted to the 
                    gospel. Parents will be help accountable for failure to teach their children the gospel. 
                    We stay with our nephews and niece and we are doing our best to teach them the gospel.
