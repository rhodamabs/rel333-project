                    From the topics that I have chosen Atonement. The reason why I chose atonement is so I can heal 
                    and be comforted. My plan is to read the talks and scriptures about the atonement so I can find
                     comfort. This was inspired by the talks I came across as I was looking for quotes for the 
                     practicum. I sought to hear the words of the Lord through His servants what the Lord says 
                     about childlessness. I read a talk entitled “Is There No Balm in Gilead?”  by 
                     Elder Brent H. Nielson given at October 2021 general conference. The experience he shared 
                     about his father gave me comfort. No matter how much I would like to also have a child of my 
                     own. I should accept the will of my Heavenly Father for he knows better than I know. 
                     It made me realize that I can cheerfully submit to the will of my Father as painful as the 
                     situation may be. Even if we do not have the answer we want that doesn’t mean that we are not
                      loved or answered. <br><br>
                    When I read a talk entitled “What Has Our Savior Done for Us?” by Elder Oaks given at the April
                     2021 General Conference. I felt as if the Lord was speaking to me directly saying He has done 
                     so much for I need not weep. He suffered because He loved me, He knows how I feel and though I
                     may not be given a chance to mother a child here, there are more waiting for me on the other
                      side. I am known and loved. I have more I am planning to read because I now feel much better
                       and the weight is being lifted. I am thankful.
