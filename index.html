                  <p>October 2019 general conference</p>
                  <q>Please do not miss an opportunity to look into the eyes of your family members with love. 
                    Children and parents, reach out to each other and express your love and appreciation.
                    Live each day together with hearts filled with gratitude, good memories, service, and much love </q>

              <p>April 2019 General Conference</p>
              <q>When a man and woman are sealed in the temple, they enter the holy order of matrimony in the new and 
                everlasting covenant, an order of the priesthood.Together they obtain and receive priesthood 
                blessings and power to direct the affairs of their family. </q>

              <p>April 2021 General Conference</p>
              <q>The only way you can have the feeling of that family embrace forever is to become worthy yourself 
                and help others to receive the sealing ordinances of the temple. We don’t know the details of 
                family connections in the spirit world or what may come after we are resurrected. But we do know 
                that the prophet Elijah came as promised to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the 
                children to the fathers.3 And we know that our eternal happiness depends on our doing our best to 
                offer the same lasting happiness to as many of our kindred as we can.</q>

              <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
              <q>Eternal doctrine also provides a distinctive perspective on children. Through this perspective we
                 see the bearing and nurturing of children as part of the divine plan. It is a joyful and sacred 
                 duty of those given the power to participate in it. Therefore, we are commanded to teach and 
                 contend for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for the development and 
                 happiness of children under God’s plan.</q>

              <p>April 2021 General Conference</p>
              <q>You who are wives and mothers are the anchors of the family. You bear the children. What an 
                enormous and sacred responsibility that is. … What is happening to our appreciation of the 
                sanctity of human life? Abortion is an evil, stark and real and repugnant, which is sweeping over 
                the earth. I plead with the women of this Church to shun it, to stand above it, to stay away from 
                those compromising situations which make it appear desirable. There may be some few circumstances 
                under which it can occur, but they are extremely limited… You are the mothers of the sons and
                 daughters of God, whose lives are sacred. Safeguarding them is a divinely given responsibility
                  which cannot be lightly brushed aside.</q>

              <p>October 2021 general conference</p>
              <q>the home-centered, Church-supported religious observance can “unleash the power of families …
                 to transform [our] home[s] into a sanctuary of faith. If we have this religious observance in 
                 our homes, we will also have the Savior’s peace. We are aware that many of you do not have the 
                 blessings of righteous homes and contend regularly with those who choose unrighteousness. 
                 The Savior can provide protection and peace to guide you ultimately to safety and shelter from 
                 life’s storms.</q>
                 <q>I assure you that the joy, love, and fulfillment experienced in loving, righteous families 
                  produce both peace and happiness. Love and kindness are at the center of having Zion in our hearts 
                  and homes</q>

              <p>April 2022 general conference</p>
              <q>Connecting with our ancestors can change our lives in surprising ways. From their trials and 
                accomplishments, we gain faith and strength.16 From their love and sacrifices, we learn to forgive 
                and move forward. Our children become resilient. We gain protection and power. Ties with ancestors 
                increase family closeness, gratitude, miracles. Such ties can bring help from the other side of the veil.</q>

              <h3><u>The Needs before Us || Bonnie L. Oscarson</u></h3>
              <p>October 2017</p>
              <q>Serving others can begin at almost any age. … It need not be on a grand scale, and it is noblest within the 
                family. Do you children realize how much it means to your parents and family members when you look for ways to 
                serve at home? For those in your teen years, strengthening and serving your family members should be among your
                 top priorities as you look for ways to change the world. Showing kindness and concern for your siblings and 
                 parents helps create an atmosphere of unity and invites the Spirit into the home. Changing the world begins 
                 with strengthening your own family</q>

        <h3><u>Position Statement</u></h3>
          <p>Family is a treasure I have. I should express my love to them often. I should create time for them 
            and should live with them in harmony, create wonderful memories together whilst they are with me. 
            I am grateful for the temple and the blessing it has offered me. A hope for continued life together 
            with my brothers and sisters. A hope of eternal joy with my husband. We are equal partners and should
             love each other and support each other. I am part of a big family. I should connect myself to my 
             ancestors through temple covenants.</p>
