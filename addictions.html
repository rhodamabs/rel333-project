                  <h3><u>Are You Sleeping through the Restoration? || President Dieter F. Uchtdorf</u></h3>
                  <p>April 2014</p>
                  <q>Addictions often begin subtly. Addictions are thin threads of repeated action that weave themselves
                     into thick bonds of habit. Negative habits have the potential to become consuming addictions. </q>

                  <p>April 2014</p>
                  <q>These binding chains of addiction can have many forms, like pornography, alcohol, sex, drugs,
                     tobacco, gambling, food, work, the Internet, or virtual reality. Satan, our common enemy, has many
                      favorite tools he uses to rob us of our divine potential to accomplish our mission in the Lord’s 
                      kingdom </q>

                  <p>October 2010</p>
                  <q>He uses addiction to steal away agency. According to the dictionary, addiction of any kind
                     means to surrender to something, thus relinquishing agency and becoming dependent on some 
                     life-destroying substance or behavior </q>

                  <p>October 2010</p>
                  <q>Satan knows how to exploit and ensnare us with artificial substances and behaviors of temporary 
                    pleasure. I have observed the impact when one struggles to win back control, to become free from destructive
                     abuse and addiction, and to regain self-esteem and independence </q>

                  <p>October 2015</p>
                  <q>Few disabilities are more crippling to our temporal or spiritual lives than addictions. Some
                     of these, like addictions to pornography or drugs, are likely to have been caused by sinful behavior. 
                     Even when that behavior has been repented of, the addiction may remain. That disabling grip can also be 
                     relieved by the decisive strength available from the Savior </q>

                  <p>October 2006</p>
                  <q>Many carry heavy burdens. Some have lost a loved one to death or care for one who is disabled.
                     Some have been wounded by divorce. Others yearn for an eternal marriage. Some are caught in 
                     the grip of addictive substances or practices like alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or pornography. 
                     Others have crippling physical or mental impairments. </q>

                  <p>April 2014</p>
                  <q>They need to know the dangers of pornography and how it overtakes lives, causing loss of the Spirit,
                     distorted feelings, deceit, damaged relationships, loss of self-control, and nearly total consumption 
                     of time, thought, and energy </q>

                  <p>April 2014</p>
                  <q>Pornography is more vile, evil, and graphic than ever before. As we counsel with our children,
                     together we can create a family plan with standards and boundaries, being proactive to protect
                      our homes with filters on electronic devices </q>

                  <h3><u>Becoming Provident Providers Temporally and Spiritually || Elder Robert D. Hales</u></h3>
                  <p>April 2009</p>
                  <q> I speak specifically of choices that have led to excessive debt and addictions to food, drugs,
                     pornography, and other patterns of thought and action that diminish one’s sense of self-worth. 
                     All of these excesses affect us individually and undermine our family relationships.  </q>
                </div>

                  <h3><u>Becoming Provident Providers Temporally and Spiritually || Elder Robert D. Hales</u></h3>
                  <p>April 2009</p>
                  <q> Unfortunately however, additional debt is incurred when we cannot control our wants and addictive
                     impulses. And for both debt and addiction, the hopeful solution is the same—we must turn to the Lord 
                     and follow His commandments. </q>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <h3><u>Position Statement</u></h3>
                <p>I learned that addictions start slowly and form habits that affect relationships as they are repeated.
                   They vary from pornography, alcohol, sex, drugs, tobacco, gambling, food, work, the Internet, or virtual reality. 
                   It was interesting to note that patterns that lead to excessive debt show some form of addiction. 
                   The Devil uses addictions to offer the temporary pleasure while destroying us. Addictions take away our agency,
                    we become slaves to our addictions. We can turn to the savior to help us rise above these addictions. 
                    He can help us offload the heavy burden of addiction. We can help each other as family members by coming up 
                    with a plan of standards and boundaries to protect us and our children.</p>
